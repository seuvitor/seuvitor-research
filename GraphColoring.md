## Introduction ##

Graph coloring is a hard combinatorial optimization problem. The Wikipedia has a page on [graph coloring](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring).

Here we present an overview of the coloring algorithms implemented in this research. Code is stored in a Subversion repository, may be viewed [via browser](http://code.google.com/p/seuvitor-research/source/browse/trunk/coloring/src/) and may be checked out anonymously using the command:
```
svn checkout http://seuvitor-research.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ seuvitor-research -read-only
```

## Comparison of implemented algorithms ##
At the [comparison section](ColoringAlgorithmsComparison.md), we summarize the results obtained by the implemented algorithms. This section will be updated as more algorithms are implemented. The tests are performed on a set of [benchmark instances](ColoringInstances.md).
