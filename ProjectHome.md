## Introduction ##
Hello, I am a M.Sc. student at PUC-Rio, more information about me is available on my [home page](http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~vdantas). In this project I will report the algorithms implemented in my research on solving timetabling and related problems.

## Graph coloring ##
Information about the graph coloring algorithms implemented can be found at the [graph coloring](GraphColoring.md) page.
