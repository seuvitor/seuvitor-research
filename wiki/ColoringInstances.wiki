#summary Description of the instance set of the graph coloring problem.

= Graph coloring instances =

The instances used in this project were proposed by [http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/Challenges/ The Second DIMACS Implementation Challenge]. The instances were generated by several authors. We give here a brief description of most classes of instances, the descriptions were taken from the DIMACS Challenge documentation. Instances can be [http://seuvitor-research.googlecode.com/files/coloring_instances.zip downloaded] from the Downloads tab.

=== Random graphs ("DSJC _n_ . _d_" instances) ===
From David Johnson. Random graphs with _n_ vertices and a density of _d_ /10.

=== Random geometric graphs ("DSJC _n_ . _r_" instances) ===
From David Johnson. Random geometric graphs constructed by randomly choosing _n_ points from the unit square. Two vertices are connected if they are distance by less than _r_.

=== Leighton graphs ("le _n_ _k_ x" instances) ===
From Craig Morgenstern. The Leighton graphs have _n_ vertices and a chromatic number _k_ equal to the size of the largest clique.

=== Flat graphs ("flat _n_ _k_ 0" instances) ===
From Joe Culberson. Flat graphs are constructed with _n_ vertices and a chromatic number _k_. The end number '0' means that all vertices are incident to the same number of vertices.

=== Register allocation graphs ("mulsol", "zeroin", "fpsol2" and "inithx" instances) ===
From Gary Lewandowski. Problem based on register allocation for variables in real codes.

=== Class scheduling graphs ("school1" instances) ===
From Gary Lewandowski. Class scheduling graphs, with and without study halls.

=== Latin square graphs ("latin_square" instances)===
From Gary Lewandowski. Latin square problem.
