#summary Implementation of coloring algorithms.

==Introduction==

Graph coloring is a hard combinatorial optimization problem. The Wikipedia has a page on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring graph coloring].

Here we present an overview of the coloring algorithms implemented in this research. Code is stored in a Subversion repository, may be viewed [http://code.google.com/p/seuvitor-research/source/browse/trunk/coloring/src/ via browser] and may be checked out anonymously using the command:
