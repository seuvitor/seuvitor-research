Graph coloring is a hard combinatorial optimization problem. The Wikipedia has a page on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring graph coloring].

Here we present an overview of the coloring algorithms implemented in this research. Code is stored in a Subversion repository, is accessible [http://seuvitor-research.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ on the browser] and may be checked out anonymously using the command:
